ed_outrider.py -- ED Outrider: a live web page for exploring Elite Dangerous: what is around you, what you have
found, and what is still on board.

Reads every Elite Dangerous journal into a local SQLite database (visited systems, jump history,
your scans, DSS ring hotspots, first discoveries, mapping, footfalls, exobiology sampling, codex
entries, sales, deaths, fuel, your fleet carrier), then tails the live journal and Status.json.
Whenever you arrive somewhere new it asks Spansh for every known system within --radius light
years (EDSM as a fallback when Spansh is down) and serves http://127.0.0.1:8025/ with:

  Nearby     known systems sorted by distance / name / value, with scan status, main star and
             scoopability, body and ring icons, notable bodies (ELW/WW/AW/terraformable), Spansh's
             credit estimate, your 🏁 first-discovery markers (sold / unsold / lost), bookmarks
  Here       every body in the current system: value as scanned and if mapped, gravity, atmosphere,
             bio genera with 0/3..3/3 sampling progress and which species they could be (outrider/bio.py
             spawn rules plus BioScan's colour check, with credit values; "one of these" with a range
             when a body has fewer signals than possible genera), ring hotspots, codex entries,
             curiosities (ringed landables, close orbits, planet pairs...), your firsts, planetary mining
             locations (⛏, with the EDFM survey's odds per ground and what your SRV mined there); as a
             list, a tree in orbital order, or a schematic of stars, planets, moons and barycentres
  Samples    every exobiology sample run (aboard / sold / lost, with value) and codex entry
  Bookmarks  systems you starred, with a note each
  Search     local database or Spansh: star classes (scoopable shortcut), planet types, ring types,
             ring hotspot minerals, unfinished exobiology, planetary mining locations (local only, optionally
             by likely mineral, or a mineral your SRV refined, those bodies first); and any system by name
             (GET /api/find)
  Map        3D canvas of the neighbourhood with your path, first discoveries, boost stars
             (neutron / white dwarf) and your carrier; fills the window; left-drag rotates,
             right-drag moves, the wheel zooms
  Highway    the Neutron Highway: a route plotted with Spansh (the exact plotter from a flown ship's Loadout, or
             the neutron plotter from a range), followed as you fly (next stop, detour, back on it, complete): the
             jump list, a top-down map on the galactic regions (or your own galaxy image), a line under the tiles on
             Overview / Nearby / Here, the next system put on
             the desktop clipboard (wl-copy / xclip) and said on arrival; optionally (Linux, off by default) the
             next system targeted after a supercharge, or on demand with 🎯 Target next / ⟳ Retry, by key
             presses in the galaxy map (outrider/target.py, the same virtual keyboard as auto honk); the drive
             maths in outrider/fsd.py, the route helpers in outrider/highway.py; [highway] in the config
  History   your sessions: jumps, light-years, firsts, mapped, footfalls, samples, codex, plus an
             all-time row and the Last session card; trips from sale to sale (paid vs estimated, what
             each death cost including exobiology), your most valuable finds; exports
  Log        every journal event with a one-line summary (outrider/log.py), filtered by category, time and
             text, read straight from the journal files and updated live
  Materials  engineering materials against their caps, and how many FSD injections and other
             syntheses (limpets, SRV refuel and repair, Rhino rig restocks) you can make (outrider/materials.py);
             Mining sites: each body your SRV mined, with minerals and tons, saved rig spots, mining locations
  My firsts  unsold first discoveries, and visited systems nearby with work worth going back for
             (Left behind, including bio signals never probed); a daily Spansh check flags unsold
             firsts someone else has scanned since ([spansh] watch_firsts)
  Now        big text for a second monitor (also ?mode=now): the system, the target, fuel, what to do
             next here, the discovery count, the unreported horizon, the data at risk, this session, the
             last lines spoken and a button bar; ↗ opens it in its own window, which stays on Now. On a planet (below
             surface_alt, or down) a heading-up surface map: you, the ship, bio sample rings, Rhino rigs (marked
             by the co-pilot button; collections placed from Status.json), saved sites and mining locations

The header shows the current system (coordinates, visit count), the commander (credits at login plus
sales since, ship), fuel (jumps left simulated from your ship's mass and your own jumps, the laden range, how
scoopable your recent stars were, jumps since the last scoop and FSD boosts on hand), core modules under
module_warn health, your
carrier (distance, UC / Vista services), the latest codex first, unsold firsts, and the unsold
cartographic + exobiology estimate from outrider/unsold.py. Targeting a system plays a sound: fanfare if
neither Spansh nor EDSM has heard of it, upbeat if it is not fully scanned, thud if you have been
there or it is fully scanned, plus an alert if you are leaving unfinished work behind. Arriving
somewhere undiscovered is announced by the voice (a sound only corrects a targeting call that was
wrong). Desktop notifications are optional (🔔 alerts). A link pill says whether the page is linked to Outrider
(linked / stale / no link), and the last line said sits beside the header's icons with ▶ to hear it again.

Alerts can be spoken (🗣): with Piper (outrider/tts.py; Cori by default, any Piper voice from Settings > Voice > More
voices) when it is installed, else the browser's voice (never alongside Piper: a line Piper cannot say is not said;
while the browser holds audio back until a click, a red "Click Here To Allow Audio" pill asks for it), in
the personalities of resources/speech.json (outrider/speech.py: business, sarcastic, sweet, with swearing versions at
a chosen rate), calling you by the names you choose. Besides the alerts the voice can say signal
counts as the FSS finds them, where the frame shift drive is taking you (said in the hyperspace tunnel, not
over the game's countdown call) and whether that star is scoopable, brief you on arrival, after the FSS, on approach and on leaving a body, welcome you back
after a break, debrief a ship loss and recap the session on quit, and it names the galactic region you cross into. Lines you tire of can be
banned from the Spoken lines list (data/speech_banned.json). Lines go through a priority queue in
one browser window (danger first; the queue clears when the FSD charges). voice_lab.py is a separate
window for trying voices and lines. Optionally the server plays the speech and the alert sounds itself
(POST /api/say/play, /api/sound/play; static/sounds.json, or your own <name>.wav files from [speech] sound_dir,
served to the page by GET /api/sound/file/{name}), so no click on the page is needed; the next line is
synthesised while one plays (POST /api/say/prefetch), and Volume is set per device. When Outrider stops
answering for 30 s, the page says "Lost contact with Outrider" in the Piper voice (made in advance; else the alert
sound). Auto honk (outrider/honk.py, Linux, optional) holds Primary Fire's
keyboard binding on arriving by hyperspace so the Discovery Scanner fires, and says how many bodies
it found. The voice can be hushed for a while (the page, or POST /api/hush: the state is the server's, so
every window and device sees it), and a co-pilot button (outrider/button.py, Linux, optional, read-only) asks the
speaking window for a status report, the last line again, or a hush until the next jump.

Other devices: /tablet is the same pages in a touch layout with nine themes (static/tablet.css, static/themes/), a
control rail of game buttons (outrider/rail.py) and, ticked in its Settings, the voice and sounds on the tablet itself;
ED Outrider for Android (a separate repository) wraps it with a wake word that asks POST /api/ask (outrider/ask.py:
fixed phrases, then an optional OpenAI-compatible AI with the read-only tools of outrider/tools.py). [server] password
signs devices in (outrider/auth.py). python3 -m outrider.mcp serves the same read-only tools to an AI client over MCP.
In Docker ([server] game_pc auto: off in a container) everything that presses keys, reads devices or plays on this
PC is off and left out of the pages; see the README and scripts/docker_bundle.sh.

The database backs itself up (a dated zip, the newest kept) at start when a day old and after quitting
the game (each copy checked with quick_check and the zip with testzip before older ones rotate out), and
every live journal is archived once into data/backups/journals/; --restore puts a zip back and --list-backups
lists them. Every request goes through a Host/Origin guard (request_guard), and a GET another site's page
sends (Sec-Fetch-Site) is refused except OPEN_GETS (/api/status and /api/status.txt, for overlays, which alone
send Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *), so another web site cannot
read the journals or trigger actions.

Body data is Spansh's merged with your own journal scans, so what you scan shows up immediately,
even for systems Spansh has never heard of. Your own data wins where both exist. Spansh bodies last reported by a pre-Odyssey client are marked
"old data" where thin-atmosphere worlds may hold unsampled life.

Each row shows how much is known about the system:

  unreported    only seen in your own NavRoute.json, nobody has reported any bodies
  no scan data  the system is known (route plot or a jump) but nothing scanned
  NN% scanned   some bodies known, fewer than the system's FSS body count
  fully scanned every body known
  N mapped      bodies DSS-mapped, as far as your own journal knows (Spansh doesn't record it)

A system that the galaxy map shows within range but this page does not list is one nobody has
reported to Spansh or EDSM -- almost certainly undiscovered.

Journal folders are auto-detected (Windows save folder, every Steam library's Proton prefix,
mounted Windows drives for older journals); --journals / --legacy / ED_JOURNALS override. Files
are remembered by path and byte offset, so a restart only reads what is new; legacy folders are
imported once. Pass --rescan to rebuild everything from scratch. --simulate (screenshots, demos) shows the
panels as if the game were running, with the last known values, and keeps every key-pressing part off.

Settings come from ed_outrider.toml next to this script (see ed_outrider.toml.example; make one with
--write-config); flags and ED_JOURNALS override it, and nothing is required. Relative paths in it are
relative to this folder. The layout: outrider/ the modules, resources/ the shipped data (bio_rules.json,
mining_odds.json, speech.json), data/ your own files (the database, browser_defaults.json,
speech_banned.json, backups/, piper-voices/; git-ignored), docs/ the notes and screenshots.
The page itself is static/page.html + page.css + page.js next to this script (edit and reload).
Tests: scripts/verify.sh runs them all (python3 -m unittest discover tests, one subject file per
tests/test_*.py, shared fakes in tests/support.py); python3 -m outrider.bio --backtest scores the bio rules against
your journals.

Requires Python 3.11+ (for reading the config file; 3.9/3.10 need `pip install tomli`) and aiohttp;
piper-tts (spoken alerts) and evdev (auto honk, Linux) are optional, as are wl-copy or xclip (the Highway's
clipboard copy, Linux).

        State.speech_path); one of those that cannot be read is a warning too. Runs on a worker thread; returns
        {path, size, kept, journals_to, copied, files, verified} (+ warning), files being the names inside the
