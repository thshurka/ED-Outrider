# ED Outrider as a server: Outrider running 24/7 on another computer, reading the game's journals from a share.
# Away from the game PC, what needs it is off ([server] game_pc = auto: off inside this container): auto honk,
# auto-target, the tablet's rail, the co-pilot button, the clipboard, sound played on the PC. See the README,
# "Running as a server (Docker)". Built where it runs (x86-64 or arm64): docker compose up -d --build
