# What Outrider reads from the game, and the traps

The game writes a journal (`Journal.<date>T<time>.<part>.log`, one JSON object per line, UTC timestamps
to the second) plus a few companion files that it rewrites in place. This lists what Outrider uses and for
what, then the behaviour of the game that the code has to work around. Everything here was checked against
the code; the constants named are in `ed_outrider.py` unless another file is given.

## Line format

- The game writes `"event":"Name"` with no space after the colon. `Journals.read_file` only parses lines
  containing one of the `WANTED` byte strings built from the `*_EVENTS` tuples, so **an event that is not in
  one of those tuples is never seen**. `outrider/unsold.py` has its own list (`INTERESTING`); `outrider/log.py` reads
  every line for the Log.
- Only complete lines are consumed (the game may be mid-write). Offsets are stored per file in
  `journal_files`; the same file seen in two folders (a copied legacy folder, two Proton prefixes) is read
  once (`twins`).
- A line missing a field the handler indexes is skipped with a message, not the whole file.

## Journal events used

| Events | What for |
|---|---|
| `FSDJump`, `CarrierJump`, `Location` | Visits, the jump path (`jumps`), current and previous position, region crossings. `FSDJump` `JumpDist`/`FuelUsed`/`FuelLevel` feed the fuel model (not when `BoostUsed`). `Taxi`/`Multicrew` mark rides that are not your ship's fuel or honk. A `Location` in the system you are already in is a relog, not an arrival. `FSDJump`/`CarrierJump`, and a `Location` that moves you (a respawn, a login elsewhere; not a relog), also move the Neutron Highway along its route (`highway_arrival`). |
| `FSDTarget` | The targeted system (sound verdict, "leaving unfinished work" check) and its star class. |
| `StartJump` | Star class of the destination. `JumpType: Hyperspace` is written as the FSD starts charging, at the start of the countdown (before the game's own countdown call): the jump card and the speech queue clearing happen here, but the jump line's words wait for Status.json's FsdJump flag (bit 30, the tunnel: a "hyperspace" moment) or 8 s. |
| `Scan` | Bodies (`own_bodies`, the record used everywhere), the arrival star's `WasDiscovered` (discovery streak verdict), first-scan `WasDiscovered`/`WasMapped`/`WasFootfalled` (`own_firsts`), landable `Materials` (jumponium), valuable finds. Nav-beacon scans (`ScanType` NavBeaconDetail/NavBeacon) never count as your discoveries. The arrival star can be scanned twice (the auto scan, then a Detailed one after the honk, or a nav beacon's): one arrival per visit. |
| `FSSDiscoveryScan` | The honk: `BodyCount`, `Progress`; triggers the arrival briefing. |
| `FSSAllBodiesFound` | All bodies found: the FSS debrief. |
| `FSSBodySignals` | Bio, geo and planetary mining location counts found by the FSS (spoken signal counts, bio finds). |
| `SAASignalsFound` | DSS results: signal counts, `Genuses` (which genera are on the body), ring hotspots. |
| `SAAScanComplete` | A body mapped (`own_mapped`, the "mapped" call-out); for a ring, the only record that it was probed. |
| `ScanBaryCentre` | Barycentre orbits for the schematic. |
| `ScanOrganic` | Sample runs: `Log` starts (and abandons any other run), `Sample`, `Analyse` completes. `Body` is the body id. |
| `CodexEntry` | Codex entries, "new to your codex", vouchers. |
| `Disembark` | Footfall on a planet (`OnPlanet`). |
| `ApproachBody`, `LeaveBody`, `Touchdown` | Approach briefing, leaving a body mid-run, the body you are at; your ship's landing spot. |
| `LaunchSRV`, `LaunchVessel`, `DockSRV`, `SRVDestroyed`, `SupercruiseExit`, `SupercruiseEntry`, `Liftoff` | Which body your SRV is out on and which SRV (`SRVType` `mev_rhino` is the Rhino); the ship marker; rigs lost with the Rhino. The Nomad launches with `LaunchVessel` (`VesselType` `lander01`, `VesselType_Localised` "Nomad") but docks with `DockSRV`, and Status.json reports it as an SRV (bit 26). `LaunchVessel` must keep the body you are on, as `LaunchSRV` does (PARSER_VERSION 37). |
| `MiningRefined` | 1 t of a commodity refined by the SRV (`own_mined`, "Mined previously", Rhino collections). |
| `MultiSellExplorationData`, `SellExplorationData` | Cartographic sales (one row per page, keyed by file:offset), which systems were sold. |
| `SellOrganicData` | Vista Genomics sales, each `BioData` entry with its `Bonus` (the x5 check). Two sales can share a second, so `bio_sales` rows are keyed by journal line (PARSER_VERSION 38); a visit sold in several goes (sales under 5 minutes apart) is one x5 check. |
| `Died`, `Resurrect` | Deaths and whether the ship (and its data) was lost (`Option`). |
| `LoadGame`, `Commander`, `Rank`, `Progress`, `Promotion`, `Statistics`, `Shutdown` | Logins and sessions, credits at login, ranks, career statistics, the quit (recap, quit backup). |
| `Loadout` | Ship, jump range, fuel capacity, unladen mass, FSD and Guardian booster, engineering modifiers, hull and core module health, rebuy. Also the latest one per `ShipID` goes to `fleet_loadouts` (`note_fleet`, `fleet_figures` in `outrider/fsd.py`): the Highway's ship list and the exact plotter's inputs. |
| `EngineerCraft` | Engineering that moves the jump range before the next `Loadout`. |
| `Cargo` (`Vessel: Ship`) | Tonnes in the hold: the ship's mass for the fuel model. |
| `FuelScoop`, `RefuelAll`, `RefuelPartial` | Last refuel. |
| `HullDamage`, `Repair`, `RepairAll`, `RepairDrone`, `AfmuRepairs`, `HeatDamage`, `Interdicted`, `JetConeBoost` | Hull and module health, danger alerts. `JetConeBoost` is the FSD supercharge signal (neutron or white dwarf cone, `BoostValue` the multiplier): the next jump's range, the "supercharged" moment, and the Highway's auto-target trigger. |
| `Docked`, `Undocked` | Docked state and services (`exploration` = Universal Cartographics, `vistagenomics`), dock/undock alerts. |
| `CarrierStats`, `CarrierLocation`, `CarrierJumpRequest`, `CarrierJumpCancelled` | Your fleet carrier. |
| `NavRouteClear` | The plotted route was cleared. |
| `FSSSignalDiscovered`, `SupercruiseDestinationDrop` | Notable stellar phenomena (`$Fixed_Event_Life_*`). |
| `Materials`, `MaterialCollected`, `MaterialDiscarded`, `Synthesis`, `MaterialTrade`, `TechnologyBroker`, `ScientificResearch`, `MissionCompleted`, `EngineerContribution` | The materials inventory (`outrider.materials.apply`; each login's `Materials` is a full snapshot). |
| `CrewHire`, `CrewFire`, `Statistics.Crew` | `outrider/unsold.py`: an NPC crew member's cut of payouts. |

## Companion files

- **Status.json** (read on mtime change, `read_status`): `Fuel.FuelMain`/`FuelReservoir`, `Flags`, `Flags2`,
  `BodyName`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Altitude`, `PlanetRadius`, `Heading`, `Cargo`, `Destination`,
  `GuiFocus`, `FireGroup`, `timestamp`. Flags used: landed (bit 1), scooping (11), FSD charging (17), in SRV
  (26), HUD analysis mode (27), altitude from average radius (29), in the hyperspace tunnel (30, FsdJump: the jump line is said once it
  comes on after a hyperspace StartJump; auto honk waits while it is set); Flags2
  bit 0 on foot, bits 3/13/14 on foot in a station, hangar or social space (counted as docked). In the SRV, the
  Nomad or a fighter (bits 25, 26), `Fuel` and `Cargo` are the vehicle's, not the ship's: the fuel tile keeps the
  ship's last figures and shows the vehicle's separately.
- **NavRoute.json** (`read_navroute`): `Route[]` of `StarSystem`, `SystemAddress`, `StarPos`, `StarClass`; the
  route strip, star classes and "unreported" systems. An empty route means it was cleared. The last hop is the
  system plotted to (`navroute_end`: auto-target's check for a waypoint beyond one jump).
- **Controls bindings** (`outrider/honk.py`): the active preset's `.binds` file in the game's Options/Bindings folder,
  for Primary Fire's keyboard binding and auto-target's (`GalaxyMapOpen`, `UI_Right`/`Left`/`Up`/`Down`, `UI_Select`,
  `UI_Back`, `CycleNextPanel`, and the galaxy map camera's `CamYaw*`, `CamZoom*`, `CamTranslate*`). `StartPreset.4.start` names a preset per line (General, Ship, SRV, On foot): the `UI_*`
  controls are read from the General one, the rest from Ship. Each control has `Primary` and `Secondary` slots; only a
  `Device="Keyboard"` slot whose `Modifier`s are all keyboard keys can be pressed.

## Traps and facts learned

**Status.json**
- It is rewritten only when something in it changes. A player standing still (a stopped Rhino included)
  produces no new reading, so "fresh" means "the game is live and this is the latest reading", not "written
  in the last second". Positions are paired with journal events only within 90 s of the event.
- With two live folders a stale Status.json in the other one must not replace the newer reading (compare
  `timestamp`).
- `Destination` appears only for navigation targets locked from the ship. A planetary mining location shows as
  `Name: "$SAA_Unknown_Signal:#type=$PlanetaryMiningLocation_Name;:#index=3;"` (`MINING_LOCATION_RE`), with
  `System` and `Body`. Targets selected from an SRV (a rig, a deposit) write nothing at all.
- The on-foot-in-station bits come from the documented flags and have not been confirmed in a live file.
- `GuiFocus` values auto-target relies on: 0 the cockpit (no panel), 6 the galaxy map (the full list is
  `outrider.target.GUI_FOCUS`). `Destination.System` is the targeted system's id64 (the check that auto-target worked); when the galaxy map plots a route of several jumps it is the first hop, and NavRoute.json's last hop is the system chosen, which auto-target also accepts.
  Flags auto-target's guards read: docked (bit 0), landed (1), FSD charging (17), in danger (22), being interdicted
  (23), in SRV (26), in the hyperspace tunnel (30); Flags2 bit 0 on foot.

**Mining and the Rhino**
- `MiningRefined` is 1 t and names neither body nor position. The body comes from the SRV state (per game
  session, `track_srv`); the position must come from Status.json at that moment. Ship-based ring mining writes
  it too and is ignored (no SRV out).
- The game logs nothing when a Rhino mining rig is deployed, picked up or targeted (preparing one only opens a
  panel: `GuiFocus` 2). Outrider therefore marks rigs with the co-pilot button (`State.mark_rig`). Frontier
  usually adds journal events some weeks after a feature ships, so rig events are expected eventually: route
  them into `mark_rig` and the pickup path and make the button optional.
- Collecting from a rig writes one `MiningRefined` per ton (plus an SRV `Cargo`) at a fixed spot right over the
  rig. One rig can give several collections; an empty rig gives nothing. Rig numbers are the lowest free slot
  1-6 and a collection leaves the rig deployed.
- A rig lands about 7 m behind the cockpit along the heading (`RIG_BEHIND_M`, from SrvSurvey; a replayed run
  put the collection within 0.3 m of that point). Pickup range is under 5 m (`RIG_TAP_M`).
- The game allowed two rigs about 44-51 m apart and draws a 50 m ring (`RIG_SPACING` default 50).
- Leash: a community guide ("Rhino Planetary Mining", CMDR Dunn Actual) found a warning at 4 km and the rig
  destroyed at 5 km (`RIG_LOST_M`). Outrider warns earlier by default (`rig_warn` 3.5 km, again at 4.5 km).
- A rig refills in about 5.5-8 minutes (same guide), hence "probably full" after 8 (`RIG_FULL_S`).
- `LoadGame` inside an SRV names the ship, but inside the Nomad its `Ship` is `Lander01` (`Ship_Localised` "Nomad"), which
  is not a ship of yours (`not_a_ship`); `Location` only says `InSRV`. The SRV type is carried over from the
  last `LaunchSRV` that was never docked. While an SRV deploys from the ship's bay, Status.json is written for some
  seconds without the in-SRV flag: never take that for "back in the ship" (only InMainShip, bit 24, a minute on).
- `Liftoff` fires for every hop between sample sites and when the ship is dismissed with you on foot; use
  `LeaveBody` for "left the body".

**Selling**
- Universal Cartographics sells 50 systems per page and writes one `MultiSellExplorationData` per page. Pages
  of one "sell all" came 7 to 67 s apart in one player's journals, so the "data still aboard" line waits 90 s
  after the last page (`SALE_QUIET_S`). Several pages can share a second, so sale rows are keyed by the
  journal file and byte offset.
- Vista Genomics pays x5 when nobody had set foot on the body; the `WasFootfalled` of your first scan decides
  (a rescan after your own landing says footfalled). A sale can sell some species and keep others aboard.

**Discovery flags**
- `WasDiscovered`, `WasMapped` and `WasFootfalled` are kept from your *first* scan of a body: after you sell,
  a rescan says "discovered". Older journals lack `WasFootfalled`; treat it as unknown, not false.

**Spansh and EDSM**
- Spansh stamps bodies uploaded through EDDN with the journal's own event time. Your own upload therefore looks
  like an update at the moment of your scan; the firsts watch allows `FIRSTS_OWN_GRACE` (120 s) for that.
- Spansh's body search cannot filter on planetary mining locations, and Spansh stores only the mining
  location count, not what a location holds or where it is. Search for them in the Local database.
- Bodies last reported by a pre-Odyssey client (before `LEGACY_CUTOFF`, 2022-11-29) have no signals block and
  thin-atmosphere worlds marked not landable: shown as "old data", never added to values.
- A system Spansh lists may still 404 on its dump for a while (`NO_DUMP_RETRY`).

**Fuel and the frame shift drive**
- Fuel per jump = `MaxFuelPerJump` x (distance / range at this mass) ^ p. `FSD_POWER` (`outrider/fsd.py`) holds p per drive size
  (size 2 = 2.00 ... size 8 = 2.90, standard and SCO alike); the Caspian's Mk II SCO drive
  (`FSD_POWER_ITEM`, `outrider/fsd.py`) is 2.5025. Guardian boosters add `GUARDIAN_BOOST` (`outrider/fsd.py`) light years. Sources: EDCD
  coriolis-data (`frame_shift_drive.json` "fuelpower", `guardian_fsd_booster.json` "jumpboost") and
  EDDiscovery's EliteDangerousCore (`ModuleList.cs` "PowerConstant", which rounds the Mk II to 2.503).
- The Caspian's **SCO Mk II** drive (`int_hyperdrive_overcharge_size8_class5_overchargebooster_mkii`): fuel multiplier
  0.011 (coriolis-data; Auto_Neutron's table says 0.004), power 2.5025, a neutron supercharge of ×6 (every other
  drive ×4), 6.8 t MaxFuelPerJump. Checked against the author's real Loadout: FSDOptimalMass 7238.5 (engineered),
  MaxFuelPerJump 6.8 and a size 5 Guardian booster (10.5 ly) give 82.97 ly, the Loadout's own `MaxJumpRange` and the
  game's. `fleet_figures` still checks every drive's figures against `MaxJumpRange` (within 1%) and, when they miss,
  plots with the optimal mass that range implies.
- `JetConeBoost` says a supercharge happened, not where: the Highway takes it as "boosted in this route system" only
  when you are at a route system (`maybe_autotarget`), and only within `HIGHWAY_LIVE_S` of the line.
- `Loadout` is only written at login and at outfitting, so an `EngineerCraft` in between is applied by hand (the
  fuel model does; `fleet_loadouts` rows stay as of their Loadout).
  Jet-cone boosts wear modules but health only updates at the next `Loadout`.

**Other**
- `Shutdown` is written only on a clean quit; a crash writes nothing, so the last event is where a session
  ended.
- `CarrierLocation` is written at login and at a booked jump's departure, but only while the game runs; a
  booked jump is assumed done 300 s after departure until confirmed (`CARRIER_SETTLE`).
- `HullDamage` also reports fighters (`PlayerPilot` false or `Fighter` true) and the SRV or Nomad you drive, whose
  lines carry no `Fighter` key at all (every ship line in the author's journals has `"Fighter": false`), and `HeatDamage` can repeat every few
  seconds (one alert per 30 s).
- A replay (re-read, legacy import, catch-up after a restart) delivers old events; anything spoken or
  position-based must check `live_event(ts)`.
