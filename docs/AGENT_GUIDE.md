# Working on ED Outrider (for contributors and their coding agents)

Read this before changing anything. It covers the code map, how data moves, how to test safely, and the
rules that keep the journal data, the page and the voice consistent. See also `JOURNAL_REFERENCE.md`
(what the game writes and its traps), `DESIGN_NOTES.md` (decisions and known limits) and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What it is

- A local web app for Elite Dangerous explorers. It reads the player's own journal files as they are written,
  keeps what it learns in SQLite, asks Spansh (and EDSM as a fallback) about nearby systems, and serves one
  page on `http://127.0.0.1:8025/` that updates live, with sounds and optional spoken alerts.
- Python 3.11+, aiohttp, no framework. The page is plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step.
- Optional parts: Piper voices (`piper-tts`), and on Linux auto honk and the co-pilot button (`evdev`).
- Licence GPL-2.0-or-later. Bundled data keeps its own licence (see the README footer).

## Code map

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `outrider/__init__.py` | `ROOT` (the repository), `RESOURCES_DIR` (`resources/`), `DATA_DIR` (`data/`): every default path starts from these. Modules with a CLI run as `python3 -m outrider.<name>` from the repository root |
| `ed_outrider.py` | Almost everything: config (`settings_from`, `config_text`), the schema (`SCHEMA`, `RESET_JOURNAL_DATA`, `open_db`), the journal reader (`class Journals`), Spansh/EDSM (`class Spansh`), the live state and every summary the page shows (`class State`), Search (`class Searcher`), backups, the web app (`make_app`, `request_guard`) and `run()`/`main()`. The Neutron Highway's state and orchestration (its maths and route helpers are in `outrider/fsd.py` and `outrider/highway.py`, imported here): `Spansh.plot`, `State.highway_id64` (the exact plotter takes id64s, not names: where you are, `find_local`, else `Spansh.system_id64`, Spansh's name search), `Journals.note_fleet`/`highway_arrival` (fleet rows, progress and detours), `State.highway_*` (summary, view, plot, store, clear, copy, background, `highway_heavy_check`: too much fuel for the next jump) and auto-target (`maybe_autotarget` the trigger, `_autotarget` the delay / honk-first wait / run on a worker thread, `start_autotarget_test` with `autotarget_test_target` (the nearest known system a plain jump away, no route needed), `start_autotarget_run(kind, countdown)` (a run the page asks for: "test", or "next" for Target next / Retry against `autotarget_target(manual=True)`, the next route system or off the route the closest one), `cancel_autotarget(route)` (the toggle off, a cleared or replaced route), `set_autotarget`, `autotarget_info`). Vehicles: `read_status` keeps the ship's fuel and cargo while you are in the SRV, the Nomad or a fighter (Status.json reports the vehicle's) and `fuel_summary` adds `vehicle` {label, fuel} |
| `outrider/core.py` | Small shared helpers with no dependencies: `iso_ts`, `ts_seconds` (journal timestamps) |
| `outrider/fsd.py` | The frame shift drive's maths, pure: the drive tables (`FSD_DATA`, `FSD_POWER`, `GUARDIAN_BOOST`...), `fsd_range`, `hop_fuel`, the fuel model fitted to your jumps (`fuel_model`, `jumps_left`), a fleet ship's plotter inputs (`fleet_figures`/`fleet_range`/`fleet_model`), `max_fuel_for_jump`/`jump_in_reach`, `conservative_range`/`conservative_optimal_mass` |
| `outrider/highway.py` | The Highway's route helpers: `highway_rows` (Spansh's answer as rows), `highway_match`, `highway_refuel_in`, `highway_text` (the spoken line), `highway_bg_file`, `HighwayError`, `class Clipboard` (wl-copy/xclip). The route's state and auto-target stay in `ed_outrider.State` (their constants are patched by verify.sh and the tests on `ed_outrider`, the Spansh URLs among them) |
| `outrider/unsold.py` | The unsold cartographic + exobiology estimate (its own journal pass, run in a thread); also journal-folder auto-detection. Works alone from the command line |
| `outrider/bio.py` | Exobiology predictor: spawn rules, colour variants, values; `--backtest`, `--update-rules`; `region_layer` (the region map for the Highway map: the run-length grid, names, label points) |
| `outrider/log.py` | The Log view: one-line summaries, read straight from the journal files on request |
| `outrider/materials.py` | Material names, grades, caps, synthesis recipes, and folding material events into an inventory |
| `outrider/speech.py` | Loads and checks `speech.json`; `KEYS` (every alert and its placeholders), `SAMPLES`, bans (`banned_path`: `data/speech_banned.json` for the shipped file, beside a copy of your own) |
| `outrider/tts.py` | Piper synthesis (`Speaker`), voice downloads (into `data/piper-voices/`), and playing lines/sounds on the PC (`LinePlayer`); `SoundBank` (the alert sounds, with your own `<name>.wav` from `[speech] sound_dir`, WAV only, up to `SOUND_FILE_MAX_S` 3 s), `scale_wav` (the page's per-device Volume applied to the WAV the PC's player gets) |
| `outrider/honk.py` | Auto honk (Linux): reads Primary Fire's binding (`keyboard_bindings` reads any controls) and presses it through a uinput virtual keyboard (`Honker`: its `owners`, "honk", "target" and "target-test", keep it open; its `lock` is held for a whole press or auto-target sequence; `press(check, cancel)` runs `check` under the lock just before the first key (a reason raises `NotNow`, nothing pressed) and `cancel` is that feature's own token, so switching one feature off stops its run while the other keeps the device open) |
| `outrider/target.py` | The Highway's auto-target: `build_steps` (the sequence; its configurable parts are `DEFAULT_SEARCH`, `DEFAULT_SUBMIT` and `DEFAULT_PLOT`, lists of `parse_step` strings found in game, see `DESIGN_NOTES.md`), `guard` (when it must not start) / `targeted` (already the target: Status.json's `Destination.System`, or NavRoute.json ending at it for a waypoint several jumps away), `Targeter` (resolves keys from the preset and `autotarget_keys`, `run`: the step runner on honk's device and lock, aborts, a cancel token, dry run), `US_KEYMAP` (typing), `ACTIONS` (the controls it may read, galaxy map camera included) |
| `outrider/button.py` | Co-pilot button (Linux): reads one HOTAS/keyboard button from `/dev/input`, read-only |
| `outrider/rail.py` | The tablet's control rail, pure: `CONTEXTS` and `context_of(status, vehicle_type)`, `CATALOGUE` (each context's buttons: action, Status.json state spec, amber) and `DEFAULT_IDS` (the agreed sets), `state_of`, `check_set` (the editor's input). `State.rail_info`/`rail_press`/`rail_save`/`rail_device` and `/api/rail*` use it; `Honker.tap` presses; `keyboard_bindings(..., category=)` reads the SRV and on-foot presets |
| `outrider/tools.py` | The AI's read-only tools, defined once: `TOOLS` (name, description, JSON-schema params, an async handler `(get, args, rows)`), `READ_ROUTES` (the GETs a handler may read; `guarded()` refuses the rest), `listing()`, `call(name, args, get, rows)`, `Unavailable` -> `NOT_RUNNING` |
| `outrider/ask.py` | The voice (`POST /api/ask`, `State.ask`): `load_phrases`/`match` (resources/ask.json, in its order), `fixed_answer` (from the tools registry, in-process through `make_app`'s `local_get`), `assistant_settings` and `ai_answer` (OpenAI-compatible chat with the registry as tools; `AIError` codes `ai_off`/`ai_timeout`/`ai_error`; every step of the provider's answer is shape-checked, and `State.ask` turns any other exception into `ai_error`). The answer goes out as a co-pilot action (`say`, or `caption` for hush/unhush) |
| `outrider/config_edit.py` | Settings' Server settings: `entries()` (every key, its value, kind and help, read from `config_text`'s output), `set_key()` (one key changed in the file in place: comments kept, a commented-out key switched on, a missing one appended after the last key's whole value, a `[section.key]` sub-table folded into the inline form), `coerce()`; `CHOICES` (plus `config_choices()` in ed_outrider.py) makes a key a pick-list. `State.config_info`/`config_save` and GET/POST `/api/config` use it (save: validated with settings_from, written atomically through a symlink to its target, the file's mode kept (0600 when new), the old file kept as `.bak`). `config_text` quotes text with `basic_string` (TOML escapes); only path keys get backslashes turned into slashes |
| `outrider/mcp.py` | The MCP bridge (`python3 -m outrider.mcp`): MCP's stdio JSON-RPC written directly (`handle`, `serve`; no SDK), `http_get` to the running server on 127.0.0.1, `mcp_settings` (`[mcp]`, also read by `settings_from`) |
| `outrider/auth.py` | `[server] password`: session tokens (`make_token`/`check_token`, HMAC, no list kept), `password_ok`, `is_loopback`, `request_token` (Bearer, then the `outrider_session` cookie), `version_tuple`, `RateLimit`. The guard itself is `session_guard` in `make_app`, the sessions `State.session_secret`/`new_session`/`session_ok`/`end_session` |
| `voice_lab.py` | A separate Tk window for trying voices and lines; not needed by the server |
| `static/page.html`, `page.css`, `page.js` | The page. `page.js` holds settings, polling, rendering, alerts and the speech queue; the Highway tab is its `hwy*` section (`loadHwy`, `renderHwyList`, `drawHwyAuto` the auto-target box from `data.autotarget`, the plot form, the map's pure `hwyFit`/`hwyToScreen`, its background `drawHwyBackground` with the region layer `hwyRegionsSet`/`hwyRegionLayer`/`hwyRegionAt`, `renderHwyLine` for the strip); `hwyAutoStart(kind)` (test now, and Target next / Retry via POST `/api/highway/target`), `hwyAimBtn` (🎯 beside "Next:"), `hwySpoken` (the Highway clause of the status report); `linkState`/`drawLinkPill` (the link pill); `outVolume` (Volume, per device); `ownSounds` (your own sound files); drawn bodies: `bodyLook` (pure: kind, colours, rim, rings, size, seed from the ids) and `drawBodyArt` (the body panel's picture, `bodyArtHtml` its caption); the maps' touch: `pinchStep` (pure) |
| `static/tablet.css`, `static/themes/`, `static/fonts/` | The tablet layout (`GET /tablet`: the same page with `body.tablet`; `load_page(tablet=True)` adds `TABLET_STYLES` and `data-theme`). `tablet.css` is structure only: the shell's grid and its neutral parts (`.tb-head`, `.tb-nav`, `.tb-main`, `.tb-rail`, `.tb-foot`, `.tb-banner`, `.tb-sheet`), every colour, font and radius a `--tb-*` custom property; each theme (`themes/lcars.css`) sets them and page.css's colours under its `[data-theme]`, and may dress a part's shape. `fonts/`: OFL fonts only, each with its `OFL-<Family>.txt`. `page.js`'s tablet section is at its end ("---- the tablet layout": `tabSetup` moves header, Now and main into `#tabMain`; `tabAutoView` the surface map's switch to Now and back; `tabRender` the status strip; `tabDrawLink`/`tabLinkText`; `tabBanner` for alerts; `tabRowTap`/`tabRowFacts`/`tabOpenRow` the row sheet over `TAB_SHEET_TABLES`; `tabOpenSettings`), its state in `TB` at the top beside `TABLET` |
| `static/sounds.json` | The alert sounds (synthesised note lists), shared by the page and the PC player |
| `resources/speech.json` | Spoken lines per alert and personality (business, sarcastic, sweet, plus `_profane` lists) |
| `resources/bio_rules.json` | Spawn rules and region map data fetched from upstream projects (refreshed at start when upstream changed) |
| `resources/mining_odds.json` | Planetary mining survey odds per ground type (EDFM, CC BY-SA 4.0); read only, never edit by hand |
| `ed_outrider.toml.example` | Every config key, commented. The real `ed_outrider.toml` is git-ignored |
| `data/` | The player's own files, git-ignored as a whole: `ed_outrider.sqlite` (default `db`), `browser_defaults.json` (beside the database), `speech_banned.json`, `backups/` (default `backup_dir`), `piper-voices/`. Created on first start |
| `docs/` | These notes; `docs/images/` the README screenshots |
| `tests/test_*.py`, `tests/support.py` | Unit tests by subject (`test_state`, `test_values`, `test_spansh`, `test_speech`, `test_devices`, `test_fuel`, `test_highway`, `test_config`, `test_pages`; unittest, in-memory SQLite). `support.py` holds the shared fixtures and fakes (`FakeGame`, `_fake_evdev`, `_HwSession`, `scan`, `T`...) and the helpers test classes share; import from it, never import a test class into another file (it would run twice). One file runs alone as `python3 -m unittest tests.test_highway` |
| `tests/page_smoke.js` | Loads the page in jsdom from a running server, opens every view, drives many page functions |
| `tests/fixtures/journals/` | Synthetic sample journals, `Status.json` and `NavRoute.json` (made-up commander and systems) |
| `scripts/verify.sh` | Runs everything below in one go against a throwaway server |
| `scripts/docker_bundle.sh` | Builds the image and saves it into `dist/ed-outrider-docker-<version>-<arch>.tgz` with a compose file for it (`image:` and `pull_policy: never` instead of `build:`, rewritten from `docker-compose.yml`), `.env.example` and INSTALL.txt. Publishes nothing |

## How data flows

1. **Journals.** `State.tick()` runs every second. For each live folder `Journals.scan_dir()` reads new bytes
   of every `Journal.*.log` from the stored offset (`journal_files`), complete lines only.
2. **Prefilter.** A line is parsed only if it contains `"event":"<Name>"` for a name in `WANTED` (built from
   the `*_EVENTS` tuples) or `Fixed_Event_Life`. `outrider/unsold.py` has its own filter (`INTERESTING`).
3. **Handling.** `Journals.handle(ev)` dispatches by event group (`handle_scan`, `handle_ship`, `handle_cmdr`,
   `handle_body`, `track_srv`...). It writes rows (visits, jumps, own_bodies, own_organic, sale_events...) and
   JSON state in `meta` (position, ship, carrier, fuel history...), and appends **moments**
   (`Journals.moment(kind, ts, ...)`) to a 16-entry deque with a growing `seq`.
4. **Status.json / NavRoute.json** are read when their mtime changes (`read_status`, `read_navroute`).
5. **Commit, then follow-up.** After the commit the tick runs the follow-ups, each on its own (one that raises is
   reported by `follow_up_failed` and the rest still run; a database error stops them): `watch_status` (scoop, FSS,
   the hyperspace tunnel `watch_tunnel`, surface map, rig leash), `maybe_refresh` (the local cache at once, then the
   Spansh sphere on arrival), `apply_own_changes`, `maybe_classify_target`, `maybe_unsold`, `maybe_sale_left`,
   carrier, sellers, the quit backup, `highway_copy_next`, `highway_heavy_check`, `maybe_autotarget`.
   `State.bump()` wakes every waiting page request.
6. **Payload.** `GET /api/nearby?since=<run>:<version>` is a long poll (25 s, 204 when nothing changed; gzipped when the browser takes it) that
   returns `State.payload()`: position, systems, target, moments (priced by `moments_summary`), fuel,
   surface map, speech info and more. Other views fetch their own endpoints: `/api/system/{id64}`,
   `/api/body`, `/api/history`, `/api/organics`, `/api/log`, `/api/materials`, `/api/map`, `/api/search`,
   `/api/firsts`, `/api/left`, `/api/find`, `/api/export`, `/api/highway` (+ `/systems?q=`, `/background`; POST `/plot`,
   `/clear`, `/autotarget` {enabled, delay}, `/autotarget/test`, `/target` {countdown?}: Target next / Retry), `/api/regions` (the Highway map's region grid), `/api/status` and `/api/status.txt`, `/api/version`, `/api/auth/signin`
   and `/signout` (see the app's contract below). The pages: `/`, `/tablet` (the same page, tablet layout), `/signin`;
   `/userfonts/{name}` serves a font from `data/fonts/`. The payload carries only the highway line's facts
   (`highway_summary`); the Highway tab fetches the route itself.
7. **Page.** `poll()` in `page.js` calls `onData()` (alerts) and `render()` (views). Moments with
   `seq > lastMomentSeq` become `alertOut(kind, title, body, {say})`: sound, desktop notification and a
   spoken line from `line(key, vars, plain)`.
8. **Speech.** `speak()` queues lines by priority (danger first; stale lines dropped; the queue clears when
   the FSD charges; a line can be held: the jump line waits for the "hyperspace" moment, at most `JUMP_LINE_WAIT`
   8 s). One window speaks (Web Locks). Audio is Piper via `/api/say`, the PC via `/api/say/play`, or the browser's
   own voice; the next line is synthesised while one plays (the PC's play request names it, the browser's Piper path
   posts it to `/api/say/prefetch`). Your own sounds come from `/api/sound/file/{name}`.

Ids: a system id64 can exceed 2^53, so the page compares the string `id` fields, never the number.

## Setup, run, test

- `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`
  (piper-tts and evdev are optional: delete their lines if you don't want them).
- `npm install` in the repo root (Node.js 22.22.2+ or 24.15+ for jsdom 30; jsdom runs the smoke test,
  playwright is only for optional screenshots and downloads no browser by itself).
- **One command:** `scripts/verify.sh`. It runs the unit tests (a ResourceWarning, such as a database a test never
  closes, fails the run: `self.addCleanup(db.close)`), pyflakes (any warning fails), `node
  --check static/page.js`, then starts a scratch server on a free port with a fresh database built from
  `tests/fixtures/journals`, a temporary config and no network, runs `tests/page_smoke.js`, and stops the
  server by its PID. All of it happens in a `mktemp` folder that is deleted afterwards. `VERBOSE=1` prints
  every smoke line and the server log.
- By hand: `python3 -m unittest discover tests` (one file: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_highway`);
  `node tests/page_smoke.js <port> [node_modules]` against a scratch server only: it clicks and POSTs, needs the port
  and refuses 8025. Waits in it: `settle(maxMs)` (the page's requests answered and quiet) rather than a fixed sleep,
  except where the page itself is on a timer. Runner (auto-target) tests can run on fake time: `use_fake_time`
  (`tests/support.py`).
- **The sample journals** (`tests/fixtures/journals`) are synthetic: commander "Sample Pilot", made-up systems
  Hesperine (a station; a sale), Corvane (a Rhino mining run) and Talvik Reach (honk, scans, a mapped body, bio
  signals, a completed and an in-progress sample run; the current system), a plotted route to Ossia, and a
  `Status.json` in supercruise. Two sessions, the first ending in `Shutdown`. Extend them by hand (keep the
  game's `{ "timestamp":"...", "event":"Name", ... }` spacing so the prefilter matches); never add real
  commander names or copy real journals.
- **A scratch server of your own** (to look at a change in a browser):
  - copy a database (`--db /tmp/x/copy.sqlite`), or let it build a fresh one from journals;
  - use a scratch config (`--config /tmp/x/scratch.toml`) with `[journals] live = [...]`,
    `[server] backup_dir` (or `backup_every_days = 0`) and `speech_file` pointing into the scratch folder,
    `[speech] server_player = "off"`, `[spansh] watch_firsts = false`, `[autohonk] enabled = false`,
    `[copilot] enabled = false`;
  - pick a spare port (`--port 8939 --host 127.0.0.1`) and stop the server by its PID, never with
    `pkill -f` (which can match your own shell);
  - for screenshots add `--simulate`: the panels read as if the game were running, with the last known values
    (`State.shown_status`, used only by the display: the fuel tile, the range, the Data tile's freshness), and the
    virtual keyboard, the co-pilot button and the clipboard are off whatever the config or the page says.
- **Never** point tests or scratch servers at your own running Outrider (port 8025 by default) or at your real
  `data/` (`ed_outrider.sqlite`, backups) / `ed_outrider.toml`. Use copies and a spare port.
- A scratch server reads journals read-only. If you point it at your real journal folder while the game is
  running, it reacts live: that is exactly why auto honk and the co-pilot must stay off.
- After a change to `outrider/bio.py`, run `python3 -m outrider.bio --backtest` on real journals; recall must not drop.

## Rules you must follow

- **`PARSER_VERSION`** (ed_outrider.py): bump it when the journal handler learns something that must be
  rebuilt from past journals (a new event, a new column filled from old lines). On the next start
  `open_db` runs `RESET_JOURNAL_DATA` and re-reads every journal once. Add a comment line saying why.
- **`CACHE_VERSION`**: bump it when the layout of cached Spansh records changes; cached systems in the old
  layout are ignored and fetched again.
- **Journal-derived vs live-only tables.** Journal-derived tables (visits, jumps, own_*, sales, codex,
  sale_events...) and meta keys must be cleared in `RESET_JOURNAL_DATA`, or a re-read doubles them.
  Live-only data (positions from Status.json, button presses, Spansh answers, estimates made at the time:
  `sample_points`, `surface_rigs`, `surface_sites`, `mining_locations`, `arrival_verdicts`, `sale_estimates`,
  `firsts_watch`, `bookmarks`, `highway_route` with its meta `highway`, the Spansh cache) cannot be rebuilt and
  must **stay out** of it (backups carry them). `fleet_loadouts` (the latest Loadout per ShipID) is journal-derived.
  Say which kind a new table is in its schema comment.
- **Out-of-order and replayed lines.** Legacy folders are imported late and a re-read replays everything:
  guard current-state updates with `self.fresh(key, ts, ...)`, and anything that should only happen during
  live play (spoken moments about losses, positions, sales in progress) with `live_event(ts)`.
- **Failed ticks.** A tick that raises is rolled back and `Journals.reload()` restores memory from the
  database; `checkpoint()`/`restore()` cover what lives only in memory (moments, sets of bodies touched,
  the collection under way...). New in-memory state changed by handling lines must be added to both, or a
  retry announces things twice. A journal line that lacks a field is skipped with a log line
  (`KeyError`/`TypeError` are caught per line); database errors must propagate so the tick is retried. The
  follow-ups after the commit run one by one: an exception is reported (`follow_up_failed`: the traceback once, the
  error on the page) and the next one still runs; `sqlite3.Error` propagates.
- **Per-browser settings** go in **both** `SETTINGS_KEYS` (top of `page.js`) and `BROWSER_SETTINGS`
  (ed_outrider.py), in the same order; a unit test compares them. Per-device things (view, layouts, which
  screen speaks, `volume`, `tilesMode`, Settings' `alertSection` and `settingsOpen` (its open sections), the tablet's `tabletView`, `tabletTheme` and
  `tabletDim`) go in neither. Object or list values need an entry in `SETTING_SHAPES`.
- **An open page reloads itself on newer page files:** the payload's `page_stamp` (`page_stamp()`: sizes and
  modification times of `PAGE_FILES`) against the `__PAGE_STAMP__` it was served with; `pageStampTick` reloads once
  nothing was touched for `RELOAD_IDLE_MS` and nothing is said, open or typed in. A new file the page loads goes in
  `PAGE_FILES` (a theme in `TABLET_STYLES` is in it already). State worth keeping across that reload belongs in
  per-device storage, as the view is. `page_stamp` and `restart_needed` come from one cached refresh (`stamps()`), so
  they always agree; the served page takes a fresh one (`stamps(fresh=True)`).
- **The tablet layout** (`body.tablet`, `TABLET` in page.js) is the same views in another shell, never a copy of them:
  a view change works on both. The tablet never speaks, plays sounds or joins the one-speaker lock (`speakMode()` is
  "never" there): keep any new sound or speech path behind `speakerHere()`. It has no Overview. The desktop page must
  not change: tablet-only rules go under `body.tablet` in `tablet.css`, themes only under their `[data-theme]` (only
  `/tablet` sets one). The dark theme's icons are CSS masks written into `themes/dark.css` by `scripts/dark_icons.py` from
  `static/icons/lucide/` (run it after changing its `ICONS`). A new theme: its stylesheet in `TABLET_STYLES`, its name in `TABLET_THEMES` and `TB.themes`,
  an `<option>` in `#tabTheme`. A font: OFL only, with its licence file (`test_tablet.py` checks); a fan font is the
  player's drop-in in `data/fonts/` (`/userfonts/`, `USER_FONT_RE`), listed first in the theme's `@font-face`.
  Every `<button>` in a `<form method="dialog">` has a `type` (`test_tablet.py` checks): a ✕ or Done is
  `type="button" data-close` (closed by one page-wide handler), since an untyped one is what Enter in a field presses.
- **Page layout: scroll the pane, not the window.** On a window of at least 900 × 600 (`appWanted`; not Now) the
  body gets `app`: it is the window's height with no page scroll, the header stays, the view fills the rest (flex
  columns with `min-height: 0` down the chain) and each `.pane` (a bordered box, tabindex in app mode) scrolls on its
  own, its `thead th` sticky. A view's controls sit above its pane. A new list goes in a `.pane` with an id (and in
  `VIEW_PANE` if it is the view's main one). Scroll with `revealIn(el)` (a row into view, under the sticky heading),
  `scrollMark`/`keepPlace` (rows added above) and `paneOf(el)`, never `window.scrollTo`/`scrollIntoView` directly;
  size things to their box in app mode, not to `innerHeight` (only Now and page mode use the window). App-mode CSS is
  the `body.app` block at the end of `page.css`; below the size nothing of it applies, so check both.
- **Loaders that can overlap** (a forced refetch, a new radius while the last answer is still on its way) take a
  `newRequest(kind)` token and drop their answer unless `isNewest(kind, token)`: a late older answer must never
  overwrite a newer one (`loadHwy`, `loadLeft`).
- **Compact tables.** The tables in `FIT_TABLES` get `compact` (then `compact2`) when they do not fit their box
  (`fitTable`, decided by `compactLevel` from the min-content width at each level; ResizeObserver plus a
  MutationObserver on the rows). A cell holds both forms: `dual(full, short, {s2})` / `sfText(kind, text)` give
  `.lf` + `.sf` (or `.sf1`/`.sf2`), the short one titled with the full text; `.c1hide`/`.c2hide` drop a column. Put
  abbreviations in `SHORT_FORMS` / `shortForm(kind, text)` (headings: `SHORT_FORMS.head`, applied at start), never
  ad hoc, and only in those tables (outside them both forms would show). Speech and notifications keep the full words.
- **Spoken lines.** Every alert key must agree across `speech.json`, `outrider.speech.KEYS` (with its placeholders),
  `outrider.speech.SAMPLES` (a value for every placeholder), a `line("key", ...)` call in `page.js` and a
  `LINE_SAMPLES` entry in `page.js`. The shipped lists hold 50 lines each for business, sarcastic, sweet and
  the two `_profane` lists; unit tests check coverage, placeholders and at least 10 per list. Danger keys
  (`DANGER` in page.js) are spoken only from business lines by default.
- **Config keys.** A new key needs: parsing in `settings_from` (with a sane default and a warning on a bad
  value), `config_text` (so `--write-config` writes it, WITH a `# help` comment on its line: Settings' Server
  settings lists every key from `config_text` through `outrider/config_edit.py` and shows that comment as its help;
  `test_settings.py` checks every key has one and can be written back), `ed_outrider.toml.example`, and the README
  Settings section. Server defaults for browser settings also go in `payload()["defaults"]` and `run()`.
- **Endpoints.** Every request passes `request_guard`: unknown Host names are refused, and a request another
  site's page sends is refused (Origin / `Sec-Fetch-Site`; `http://` or `https://` of the same Host, for an HTTPS proxy
  on the LAN; an `allowed_hosts` name is also answered without a port). The sign-in page's `next` passes `safe_next`
  (server) and `safeNext` (page) or becomes "/". Only `OPEN_GETS` (`/api/status`,
  `/api/status.txt`) may be read cross-site. Anything that changes state must be a POST. Don't widen
  `OPEN_GETS`; validate every input (ids with `parse_id64`, JSON with `json_object`). Then `session_guard`: with
  `[server] password` set, a request not from loopback needs a session, except `AUTH_OPEN` and `OPEN_GETS`; without
  one, 401 `signin_required` for `/api/`, `/static/` and the app's User-Agent (`OutriderApp/`), else a redirect to
  `/signin`. Don't add to `AUTH_OPEN`. Tests reach "another device" by patching `outrider.auth.is_loopback`
  (`tests/test_auth.py`).
- **Docker** (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/entrypoint.sh`, `.dockerignore`): the image sets
  `OUTRIDER_CONTAINER=1` (so `game_pc` auto is off), writes a first-run config into `/config`, and is checked by
  `test_server_mode.Packaging` without Docker; build and run it by hand (`docker build`, `docker run` with scratch
  folders) after changing it. verify.sh never needs Docker.
- **Stopping.** SIGTERM (docker stop, systemd) sets `run()`'s stop event: the same cleanup as Ctrl-C (tasks
  cancelled, commit, the quit backup, "stopped cleanly", exit 0). `verify.sh` stops its scratch server that way and
  fails if it does not stop cleanly.
- **Server mode** (`[server] game_pc`, `State.game_pc`; `resolve_game_pc`: auto is off inside a container). Off: no
  virtual keyboard (`simulate_keyboard_off`), no co-pilot button or clipboard (`simulate_settings`), the PC player off;
  every route that presses keys or plays on this PC is registered through `pc_only()` and answers 409 `not_game_pc`.
  A new such route goes through `pc_only()` too; the payload's `game_pc` tells the page what to leave out: the page sets
  `body.notgamepc`, which hides every `.pcOnly` element and `[data-aim]` button (mark a new game-PC control `pcOnly`).
- **The rail presses keys** (like auto honk and auto-target): one tap of one bound key combination per press
  (`Honker.tap`), only for a button in the CURRENT context's set, only while the game is live, never with --simulate,
  and refused (not queued) while auto honk or auto-target hold the keyboard. Never a sequence. Tests use
  `_fake_evdev()` and a recording UI (`tests/test_rail.py`), never `Honker.open()`. Its sets are live-only meta
  (`rail_sets`), out of `RESET_JOURNAL_DATA`. `close()` never waits for the lock: whoever holds it (`tap`, `press`,
  auto-target) closes the device on its way out when `stop` is set, whichever way it leaves.
- **The AI's tools are read-only, by rule** (`outrider/tools.py`). A handler reads only through the `get` it is given,
  and only `READ_ROUTES` (GET routes that change nothing; `/api/find` is out because it can store a system). Never add
  a POST route or a tool that acts (presses, plots, bookmarks, hushes): `test_mcp.py` walks every tool and checks.
  A new tool goes in the registry once; the MCP bridge and the voice's AI layer both serve it. Keep answers compact
  (`capped`, the fields that answer the question).
- **The Android app's contract** (`project/done/plans/PLAN-tablet-2026-10-02.md`). `GET /api/version` answers exactly
  `{outrider, api, min_app, password, signed_in}`; `POST /api/auth/signin` {password} gives `{ok, token}` and the
  cookie; `POST /api/auth/signout`; `POST /api/ask` {text, source?} gives exactly `{answer, spoken, matched, command}`; `/api/version` also has `game_pc`
  (added 2026-10-04);
  errors are `{error, code}` (`signin_required`, `bad_password`, `rate_limited`,
  `bad_request`, `app_too_old`, `server_error`, `ai_off`, `ai_timeout`, `ai_error`). Bump `API_VERSION` when an endpoint the app uses changes shape
  incompatibly, `MIN_APP_VERSION` when an older app can no longer work (426 `app_too_old` for its
  `X-Outrider-App` header), and `outrider.__version__` with each release. The app's tests depend on these shapes.
- **Devices.** Never exercise auto honk (uinput key presses: they go to whatever window has focus, including
  a running game) or the co-pilot button (reads `/dev/input`) against a real game or device from tests or a
  scratch server, and the same for auto-target (it opens the galaxy map and types): tests use `FakeGame` (a fake
  device that plays the galaxy map) with `_fake_evdev()` (key codes, no `UInput`), never `Honker.open()` on real evdev.
  Never POST to `/api/highway/autotarget/test` or `/api/highway/target` on a server that sees a live game. Use the existing fakes: `FakeGame`, `_fake_evdev()`,
  `button_fake_evdev`, `FakeClock`/`use_fake_time` in `tests/support.py`, and the local `FakeHonker`/`FakeUI` classes
  in `test_devices.py` and `test_config.py` as patterns. Never POST to `/api/autohonk` or `/api/autohonk/test` on a server that sees a live game.
- **No stray side effects.** Don't download Piper voices into the real `data/piper-voices/`, don't let a test
  rewrite `resources/bio_rules.json`, and don't write the real `data/speech_banned.json` (use a speech file in a
  temp folder: its bans go beside it).
- **Every fix gets a test that fails without it.** Unit tests feed synthetic events to `Journals.handle()` on
  `open_db(":memory:")`; page behaviour goes in `page_smoke.js`, injecting the data it needs through
  `window.eval` rather than relying on anyone's real database.

## Recipes

**A new alert (moment).**
1. In the handler, `self.moment("my_kind", ts, ...)` with plain JSON fields (ids as ints; `live_event(ts)` if
   it must not fire on a re-read).
2. If it needs pricing or names, add them in `State.moments_summary()` / `moment_extra()`.
3. In `onData()` (page.js), a branch for `m.kind === "my_kind"` calling `alertOut(...)`; reuse an `ALERTS` row
   or add one (its id is the per-alert sound/notify/speak switch).
4. A spoken line: see below. Tests: a unit test for the moment, a smoke check for the page's reaction.

**A new column.** Add it to the `CREATE TABLE` in `SCHEMA`; `open_db` adds missing columns to old databases.
If it is filled from journals, write it in the handler and bump `PARSER_VERSION`; if from Spansh records,
bump `CACHE_VERSION`. Old rows have NULL: code must cope.

**A new setting.** Page-only: a `store.get(key, default)`/`store.set` pair, the key in `SETTINGS_KEYS` and
`BROWSER_SETTINGS` (same position), a control in the Settings dialog (in the section it belongs to). With a config default: the four config
places above plus `data.defaults`.

**A new spoken line.** `outrider.speech.KEYS["key"] = "when it is said: {placeholders}"`, `SAMPLES["key"]`, an entry
in `speech.json` (`"when"` plus five lists), `line("key", vars, "plain fallback")` in page.js, and
`LINE_SAMPLES.key`. Run the unit tests: they name what is missing.

**A Spansh job (the Highway's plotters).** Spansh answers a plot with `{job}`; `Spansh.plot(url, params)` asks
`SPANSH_RESULTS` every `HIGHWAY_POLL_S` (1.5 s) until `result` comes, gives up after `HIGHWAY_PLOT_TIMEOUT` (180 s),
runs one plot at a time (`sem_plot`) and raises `HighwayError` in words for the page. The POST handler validates the
body, starts the job as a background task (`State.highway_task`, cancelled by clear and at shutdown) and answers
202 at once; the page polls `GET /api/highway` while `plotting.state` is `running`. Unit tests use a fake session,
never Spansh; `verify.sh` points every `SPANSH_*` URL at a closed port and sets `Clipboard.TOOLS = ()`, so a
scratch server neither plots nor touches the desktop clipboard. Moments about the route are kind `highway`
(`what`: next, back, off_route, complete, heavy; plain `text`, no `speech.json` keys yet), only for `live_event` arrivals.

**A new journal event.** Add its name to the right `*_EVENTS` tuple (or `WANTED` never lets the line through),
handle it, decide journal-derived vs live-only, bump `PARSER_VERSION` if past journals matter, add a
summary in `outrider/log.py` if the Log should word it, and add the event to `tests/fixtures/journals` if the page
should show it. Check `JOURNAL_REFERENCE.md` for the event's quirks.

## Design principles

- Everything comes from the player's own journals and public community data. Nothing is tuned to one ship,
  one commander or one machine: the fuel model fits the player's own jumps, thresholds are settings.
- Never present a guess as a fact. Predictions say "up to", "could be", "odds, not contents",
  "probably full"; Outrider's own record (rig marks) is labelled as such, not as the game's.
- Alerts are for the out of the ordinary. Routine systems stay quiet.
- Nothing is uploaded. Outside calls are read-only lookups (Spansh, EDSM, GitHub for rules, Hugging Face
  for voices).
- The README stays tight: user-facing, short bullets. Implementation detail belongs in code comments.
- Per-player defaults (names the voice uses, thresholds, voice) are only defaults; never hard-code a
  player's preference.
- Keep optional parts optional: the server must run without Piper, evdev, network or journals.
