ED Outrider reads your Elite Dangerous journals as you play and keeps one browser tab up to date
with the things an explorer keeps alt-tabbing to find out: **whether anyone has been to the
systems near you, what's in the one you're in, what your unsold data is worth, and whether you're
about to jump away from something you'll regret leaving.**

It runs on your own machine. It asks [Spansh](https://spansh.co.uk) (and
[EDSM](https://www.edsm.net) as a backup) what the community already knows about the systems
around you, then layers your own scans on top — nothing is ever uploaded.

## ✨ At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔭 **Find the undiscovered** | Every known system within 25 ly is listed. If the galaxy map shows one that *isn't* on the page, nobody with an uploader has been there. |
| 🔊 **Hear it before you jump** | Target a system and get a fanfare if it's a brand-new discovery, a cheerful note if it's known but unscanned, a thud if it's been done. |
| 🪐 **See the whole system** | Every body: value, gravity, atmosphere, rings and hotspots, curiosities, and which exobiology species it could hold — before you probe or land. |
| ⚠️ **Don't leave money behind** | Target onward with mapping or exobiology worth your while still undone and the page says so, out loud if you like. Ordinary systems stay quiet. |
| 💰 **Know what's on board** | Unsold cartographics and exobiology in credits, bonuses included, and your unsold 🏁 first discoveries. Dock somewhere that buys it and it tells you to sell. |
| 🌿 **On the ground** | What is left to sample on the body, a countdown to the next colony, and a warning when a run elsewhere would be discarded. |
| ⛽ **Fuel you can trust** | Jumps left at max range and at your pace, laden range, fuel per hop, how scoopable your recent stars have been, and a nudge to top up before a dry stretch. |
| 🧭 **Decide where to go** | Unfinished systems nearby, the nearest buyers for your data, bookmarks and a next stop, stellar phenomena, and a search across Spansh. |
| 🛣 **Neutron Highway** | Plot a neutron route with Spansh for any ship you have flown; Outrider follows it as you fly, says the next stop and puts its name on the clipboard for the galaxy map. |
| 📜 **Your logbook** | Every journal event in a searchable log, every exobiology sample and what became of it, and a schematic of the system. |
| 📈 **The long view** | Each trip from sale to sale with what it actually paid, what each ship loss cost, your best finds, ranks and career statistics. |
| 🗣 **A voice with personality** | A natural neural voice, down to business, sarcastic or sweet, briefing you on arrival and warning before you leave something unfinished. |
| 🎯 **Auto honk** | On Linux, Outrider can fire the Discovery Scanner for you on arrival. |
| 🕹️ **Co-pilot button** | On Linux, one HOTAS button asks for a status report, the last line again, or quiet until the next jump. |
| ⛏️ **Rhino mining** | A heading-up surface map on Now with your rigs, sample points and ship; the co-pilot button marks rigs, and every collection is kept per body. |

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt   # Python 3.11 or newer
.venv/bin/python ed_outrider.py
```

Open **<http://127.0.0.1:8025/>** and go fly.

> [!TIP]
> The first start reads all your journals (a few seconds); after that it only reads what's new.
> Journal folders are found automatically on Windows and Steam/Proton. Click the page once so
> the browser allows sound.

`requirements.txt` also installs two optional parts; leave either line out if you don't want it:

- **Piper** (`piper-tts`, about 100 MB) for a natural speaking voice.
- **evdev** (Linux only) for auto honk and the co-pilot button. It is built from source, so it needs your
  distribution's Python development headers.

Start Outrider with the `.venv`'s Python (`.venv/bin/python ed_outrider.py`, as above): plain `python3 ed_outrider.py` finds Piper and evdev in a `.venv` in the Outrider folder, but aiohttp must then be installed for that `python3` too.
Your own files (the database, backups, downloaded voices, banned lines) all go in `data/`.

## 🖥️ The views

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<b>Nearby</b> — every known system within range (20–50 ly, the Where tile's dropdown): distance, how much
is scanned, the main star and whether it scoops, notable bodies, curiosities (🔭) and a credit estimate. Sort,
or hide visited and fully scanned systems. A dashed <i>old data</i> mark flags Spansh records from before
Odyssey (thin-atmosphere planets there may hold unsampled life). ⛏ N counts planetary mining locations on

The to-do line ticks itself off as you honk, map and sample, in a suggested order with supercruise time and

</table>

The **Overview** at the top shows Here and Nearby together: drag the divider, swap sides or stack them.

On a window of at least about 900 × 600 the page fits the window: the header stays put and each list scrolls
in its own box. **▴** folds the tiles into one line (remembered on this device; the alerts dialog's Settings can fold
them only on a small window). A table too wide for its box
switches to short forms ("HMC", "G star"; hover for the full text) rather than scroll sideways.

**Now** is the cockpit view for a second monitor or a tablet, in big text: the system, the target, fuel,
what to do next, the body you have targeted, and the nearest unvisited system.

- An **at-risk line** shows what is aboard against your rebuy ("🗺 380M · 🧬 412M aboard · 3.2× rebuy").
- **This session** since your login: "2 h 14 · 74 jumps · 612 ly · 6 new systems · 11 mapped · 4 samples ·
  ~38.0M found" (the unsold estimate's change plus what you sold). After you quit, the last session.
- **Captions** show the last three lines said; tap one to hear it again. A corner bar has 🗣, hush 30 min,
  status report and ✕ back.
- **↗** beside the Now button opens Now in its own window, or open `http://127.0.0.1:8025/?mode=now`,
  which stays on Now even after a stray click or a reload.
- It keeps the screen awake on localhost or HTTPS. On a tablet over plain http, set its screen timeout.
- On a planet, the **surface map** appears under the lines (see below).

The **header** shows the galactic region, ranks, fuel, hull, any core module under your level (`module_warn`,
80%; as of the last Loadout or repair, since the journal logs nothing in between), your carrier's jump countdown,
the nearest places to sell, and the last backup.

The **fuel tile** counts jumps as the ship gets lighter ("≈6 jumps at max range (484 ly), 3,500 at your pace"),
for any drive, engineered or not, from your own Loadout and jumps. Nearby shows laden range and the targeted
jump's cost ("38.2 ly · 0.9 t · leaves 5 max jumps"). "scoopable: 9 of last 20" turns amber when your fuel is
short for the gaps between scoopable stars. In the SRV or the Nomad it keeps the ship's tank and adds the
vehicle's own fuel.

Under the Where tile, the **discovery streak** is a dot per arrival for your last 20 (gold: first discovery,
amber: bodies nobody had reported, blue: known, grey: revisited), and the **unreported horizon**: "nearest
known unvisited: Xyz 4.8 ly". Any unvisited star closer than that on the galaxy map is one nobody has reported.

## 📱 On a tablet

Open `http://<your PC>:8025/tablet` on a tablet in landscape (made for the Galaxy Tab A11+, about 1280 × 800):
the same pages in a cockpit layout, here with its first theme, LCARS.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/tablet.png" alt="The tablet layout on Now, with the surface map: the status strip on top, the pages on the left" width="900">
</p>

- **The strip on top** shows the system, fuel and unsold data, and the link to Outrider in words
  ("LINKED · 2 S AGO", "STALE · 48 S AGO", "NO LINK · RETRYING").
- **The pages** are on the left in three groups of four: Explore (Now, Nearby, Here, Samples), Navigate (Bookmarks,
  Search, Map, Highway) and Records (History, Log, Materials, My firsts). There is no Overview.
- **Tap a row** in a table for all of its facts, including the columns too narrow to show, with Show in Here and
  Bookmark.
- **The maps by touch:** on the galaxy map one finger rotates, two fingers move it and a pinch zooms; on the Highway
  map two fingers move and pinch.
- **On a planet** the tablet switches to Now when the surface map appears (the Now button says MAP) and back to your
  page when it goes. Nothing else switches pages by itself.
- **The voice stays on the PC.** The tablet never speaks or plays sounds: an alert is a banner across the top (red
  for danger), and the footer has Hush, Status report and the last line said.
- **Target next** on the Highway runs at once (no countdown), since tapping the tablet leaves the game focused. Auto
  honk, auto-target's switch and test, backups and the voice settings stay on the PC.
- **Settings** (bottom right) has the theme, a dim switch, the screen size in CSS pixels and Sign out.
- **The control rail** on the right: up to eight game buttons for where you are (ship, SRV, Nomad, fighter, on
  foot), each pressing that control's keyboard binding on the PC once. The defaults are landing gear, cargo scoop,
  night vision, ship lights, flight assist, silent running, hardpoints and analysis mode; the SRV, the Nomad and
  fighters, and on foot have their own. A button shows the game's state (Status.json), SENT until the game confirms
  a press, and "not confirmed" if it doesn't. A control with no keyboard binding says "bind a key" (give it a second,
  keyboard binding in Elite's controls). Edit chooses, renames and orders each set (stored on the PC). The rail
  presses keys only while the game runs, through auto honk's virtual keyboard (Linux), and never while auto honk or
  auto-target is pressing; one tap per button, never a sequence.

Outrider must listen on your network for this (`[server] host = "0.0.0.0"`). With `[server] password` set, the tablet
signs in once: see "Opening the page from another device" under Settings. The fonts are Antonio and Barlow Condensed,
both under the SIL Open Font License and shipped with Outrider. If you have an LCARS font of your own, save it as
`data/fonts/lcars-display.ttf` and the theme uses it for its headings. It stays in your git-ignored `data/` folder.

## 🤖 Ask an AI about your game

An AI client you already use (Claude Code, the Claude desktop app, or any other MCP client) can ask Outrider questions
in plain language: "what's worth landing on here?", "how much am I carrying unsold?", "what's left within 50 ly?",
"how far to the next refuel on the highway?". The client starts `python3 -m outrider.mcp`, which reads your running
Outrider and answers through ten read-only tools. These are current status, this system, nearby systems, the nearest
unvisited system, one body, unsold data, work left behind, the Highway route, travel history and materials.
It can only read: it never presses keys, plots, bookmarks or hushes anything. Nothing extra to install.

- **Claude Code**, from the Outrider folder: `claude mcp add --transport stdio outrider -- python3 -m outrider.mcp`
  (add `--scope user` to have it in every project). Use the venv's python if Outrider runs in one.
- **Claude desktop app:** add to `claude_desktop_config.json` under `mcpServers`:
  `"outrider": {"command": "python3", "args": ["-m", "outrider.mcp"], "cwd": "/path/to/Outrider"}`.
- If Outrider isn't running, the tools say so. `[mcp] url` points the bridge elsewhere (default: this PC at
  `[server] port`); `[mcp] max_rows` caps how many rows a list answers with (25).
- **Privacy:** Outrider uploads nothing, but what the tools answer goes to your AI client's provider like anything
  else you type into it. A client running a local model keeps everything on your PC.

## 🔔 Alerts

Alerts fire only for something out of the ordinary. Each can play a sound (🔊), show a desktop
notification and be spoken (🗣), chosen per alert in the **🔔 alerts** dialog:

- a new discovery targeted, or arriving somewhere nobody has been
- leaving with mapping or bio over your levels undone, or a first-discovered Earth-like, water, ammonia or
  terraformable world unmapped
- a valuable body the moment the FSS resolves it, and a new codex entry
- low fuel where you cannot scoop, and a top-up worth taking before a dry stretch
- docking where the station buys your data, and what you banked when you sold
- a sale that left data aboard (Universal Cartographics sells 50 systems a page; at Vista Genomics, the species
  you kept back), said 90 seconds after the last page
- hull damage, heat damage, interdiction, and unsold data past a threshold
- your carrier arriving somewhere new or leaving without you
- a Rhino mining rig nearing the 5 km leash, and rigs still marked out when you dock the Rhino (see The surface map)

Spoken but not notified unless you tick it: the arrival briefing, the FSS debrief, leaving a body with
sampling unfinished, each species completed, tank full, a high-gravity approach with a lot aboard, the
Neutron Highway's next stop, auto-target's result, the jump line, auto honk's result, and discovery streaks (ten known systems in a row, or five undiscovered). Off
until ticked: **jumponium** (see the voice, below).

The same dialog holds the thresholds. Your browser remembers them; the config file sets what a new
browser starts with.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Exobiology | 10M | A body only counts as unfinished bio if one body could pay over this. |
| Unsold data | 50M / 250M | When the header turns amber and red, or as a multiple of your rebuy. |
| Body highlights | 500k / 10M | Here's row turns green (scan + map) or its bio violet (species) over these. Bonuses left out. |
| Approach warning | 2 g | Gravity at which orbital cruise at a landable body warns you, with data over the amber level. |
| Max with bonuses | on | Whether Here's Max column counts first-discovery, mapping and footfall bonuses. |
| Discovery streak | 10 / 5 | Known or undiscovered systems in a row for a spoken line (0 turns it off). |
| Suggested order | 100k/min | Supercruise credits per minute under which Here marks "skip?". |
| Fuel alerts under N jumps | off | Warns once when jumps left at your pace fall under N; also sets the top-up level. |
| Core modules | 80% | A core module under this shows under hull and is said in the status report. |
| Surface map | 1,000 m / 500 m / 50 m / 3,500 m | Altitude it shows below, narrowest view, rig spacing ring (0 = none), rig leash warning. |

**Export settings** and **Import settings** move them to another browser profile. **Use these for new
browsers** keeps a copy on the server (`data/browser_defaults.json`, included in backups), so a tablet running
Now starts with your voice, names and alert choices. The view and layouts stay per device.

Targeting a system plays its sound; arriving is announced by the voice. Walking about a station counts
as docked. A carrier jump booked just before you quit shows as "not yet confirmed" until your next login.

## 💾 Backups

Outrider backs itself up at start when the last backup is over a day old, and a few seconds after you quit
the game. **Back up now** in the Data tile does it on demand.

- Each backup is a dated zip in `data/backups/` holding the database, `browser_defaults.json`, the speech files
  and your config file. The newest 7 are kept (`backup_keep`).
- Every journal is also copied into `data/backups/journals/` and never deleted. Under Steam/Proton an uninstall
  deletes your journals, so this copy matters.
- Every backup is checked before it counts; a bad one never rotates a good one out.
- The Data tile reads "backed up 3 h ago · verified · 7 kept", amber when overdue, red when one failed.
- `backup_every_days = 0` turns automatic backups off.

**Restoring.** The journals alone can rebuild everything:
`python3 ed_outrider.py --legacy data/backups/journals` reads them into a fresh database.

To get the database back (bookmarks, the Spansh cache, your settings), stop Outrider and run
`python3 ed_outrider.py --restore` for the newest zip, or name one
(`--restore outrider-ed_outrider-20260930-181500Z.zip`). It refuses while Outrider is running, checks the zip
first, and keeps the database it replaces as `ed_outrider.sqlite.pre-restore-<date-time>`. `--list-backups`
lists the zips; add `--db` for a second database. `--restore` leaves `speech.json`, `speech_banned.json` and
`ed_outrider.toml` alone: unzip those by hand if you need them (an old `speech.json` lacks newer lines).

## 🗣 The voice

Alerts are spoken when 🗣 in the header is on. **Piper**, a neural voice running on your CPU, sounds far
better than the browser's own voice, which is used when Piper isn't installed. The voice (`voice` in the
config file) downloads into `data/piper-voices/` the first time; the dialog switches between installed voices.

**Choosing how it sounds**

- **Personalities.** Down to business, sarcastic and sweet, fifty lines per alert each; tick any mix.
  **With profanity** adds swearing versions. **One personality per system** holds one character a system.
- **Danger alerts always down to business** (on by default): danger is said plainly, never sworn.
- **Your names.** Commander names are often unpronounceable, so the voice calls you by the names in
  **Call me** (default "Boss, Hefay, Sir").
- **Speed.** 1× is the voice's own pace. Some Piper voices respond to it less than others.
- **Your own lines.** Edit `resources/speech.json` (or a copy named by `speech_file`) to change lines or add a personality; no restart needed.
- **A voice per personality.** In `speech.json`, a personality can name its own installed Piper voice and
  speed: `"sarcastic": {"label": "Sarcastic", "voice": "en_US-ryan-high", "speed": 1.1}`. Each extra voice
  takes 60–100 MB of memory.

**What it says**

- **Arrival briefing.** One sentence after the honk: "Known. 12 bodies. Scoopable M star. The Earth-like
  world at A 2 is unmapped, 1.4 million." Entering a new galactic region opens it ("Entering the Norma Arm.").
- **Routine systems: sound only** (a tick, off by default) plays a soft two-note sound instead of the
  briefing where there is nothing to do.
- **FSS debrief:** what is worth doing once every body is found. **Signals** as the FSS finds them.
  **The jump line** in the hyperspace tunnel, with whether the star ahead is scoopable, and any hazard.
- **Greeting and goodbye:** what is at stake after a long break (and any core module under your level), and a
  session recap when you quit.
- **Exobiology:** leaving a body mid-run warns; the third sample says what it paid and what is left.
- **Approach:** "2.6 g. 480 million aboard, 3.2 rebuys. Land gently."
- **Fuel:** low fuel where you can't scoop, and the **top-up warning** before a likely dry stretch.
- **Jumponium** (off by default): the best landable body with a material your FSD injections are short
  of ("B 4 has polonium, 1.3 percent.").
- **Mapped** (off by default: **Say when a planet is mapped**, or `speak_mapped`): after each DSS mapping,
  "A 2 mapped efficiently, 3.4 million. Next: biology on C 2, up to 19 million." It says so when you went
  over the probe target, and "Nothing else here over your levels" when the system is done. A map to do next gives
  the body's value without and with your bonuses: "Next: map 7, 771 thousand, 2.2 million with bonuses".
- **Ship-loss debrief:** what went down with the ship and the nearest lost system to go back to.
- **System names said properly:** "Drojau LL-O b26-3" is said "Drojau L L O, b 26 3".

**How it behaves**

- **Most urgent first.** Danger jumps the queue. Lines that waited over 20 seconds, or are about a system
  you've left, are dropped. Charging the frame shift drive clears the queue.
- **No repeats too soon.** Each alert goes through every line in your personalities before any comes round
  again. The browser remembers what you have heard across reloads.
- **Hush.** The **▾** beside 🗣 hushes for 10 minutes, 30 minutes or until the next jump. Danger and anything
  you ask for still speak. The hush is kept by Outrider, so a hush from a tablet or the co-pilot button
  quiets the PC too.
- **One window speaks.** With the page open in several windows, only one speaks and plays sounds, so nothing
  is said twice. **Speak from this window** takes over; **This screen speaks: auto / always / never** sets it
  per browser.
- **Play speech and sounds on this PC.** Ticked in the dialog, the PC running Outrider plays the voice and
  sounds itself: no click to allow audio, and the voice comes from the PC even with the page on a tablet (a page
  must still be open). Linux only: `pw-play`, `paplay`, `aplay` or `ffplay` (`[speech] server_player`).
- **Volume** (in the dialog, per device) sets Outrider's own voice and sounds, in the browser or on the PC.
- **Your own sounds:** `[speech] sound_dir` names a folder of `<name>.wav` files (fanfare, thud, chime, alert… the
  names in `static/sounds.json`), up to 3 seconds each; each replaces that sound in the browser and on the PC. The
  dialog lists the ones it uses and why any file is not used.
- **The jump line** ("Jumping to Hwy Stop 38") is said once you are in the hyperspace tunnel, not over the game's
  own countdown call; it has its own varied lines in `speech.json` (`fsd_charge`). The scoop and hazard warnings
  are said after it.
- **The last line said** shows beside the header's icons, with ▶ to hear it again.
- **Lost contact.** If Outrider stops answering for 30 seconds, the speaking window says "Lost contact with
  Outrider" in the browser's own voice, and again when it is back.

**Spoken lines: what was said, and banning lines**

Open the 🔔 alerts dialog and scroll to the very bottom. The collapsed **Spoken lines** section lists this
window's last 100 alerts and what became of each: said, cut short, dropped or silent, and why. **copy**
puts it on the clipboard.

- Above the list, **This session** counts each alert's lines, noisiest first ("Arrival brief 42 · FSD charge
  40 (3 dropped)"). **🔇** beside one stops speaking that alert (its 🗣 tick), with an undo.
- Press **👎** beside a line to never hear that wording again, in any browser or in the voice lab.
- "3 lines banned · review / undo" above the list lets you take a ban back.
- Bans live in `data/speech_banned.json` (beside your own copy when `speech_file` names one), so editing
  `speech.json` never loses them.
- The last line of a list can't be banned, so no alert ever goes quiet.

**The voice lab.** `python3 voice_lab.py` opens a small window for trying voices before you settle on one.
Play a random line from any alert and personality, or type your own; Save WAV keeps it. **✂ Cut this line**
bans it, like 👎. **▶ Audition** plays eight key alerts in a row. The lower half lists every Piper voice on
Hugging Face: double-click one to download it for Outrider too.

## 🗺️ The surface map

On a planet, Now shows a map under its lines: on the ground, in the SRV, on foot, or flying below 1,000 m
(it hides again 100 m higher). Hiding deletes nothing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/surface.png" alt="The surface map on Now: rigs, samples, a mining location and the ship" width="900">
</p>

- **Heading-up:** the way you face is the top, you are the arrow in the middle, N on the rim is north. It
  zooms to fit everything within 3 km, never narrower than 500 m, with a scale bar.
- **What is drawn:** your ship (a landing-pad H), the samples of unfinished bio runs with each species' colony ring (the
  current run solid), your rigs 1–6 with a faint spacing ring, saved sites (U1… unmarked, S1… rigs picked
  up) and mining locations (L3). Anything off the map is a chevron on the rim.
- **The legend** names each tag, nearest first. Six rig slots mirror the game's HUD: mineral (or
  "placed"), tons so far, distance and bearing. A solid rig is **probably full**: 8 minutes since it was
  placed or last collected from.
- **The leash:** the game destroys a rig 5 km from its Rhino. Past 3.5 km it turns red and the voice warns,
  again at 4.5 km ("Rig 3 is 3.8 kilometres away, behind you; it is lost at 5.": which way, in eight sectors).
- **Strip copy:** a tick in the dialog adds a small copy to the on-body strip, with a one-line legend.

**Marking rigs.** The game logs nothing when you deploy or pick up a rig, so you tell Outrider with the
co-pilot button. In the Rhino on a planet:

- **Tap away from your rigs:** the next rig (lowest free number, 1–6) is placed 7 m behind you, where the
  game drops it. "Rig 3 placed."
- **Tap within 5 m of a rig:** it is picked up and its number is free again.
- The button does nothing else in the Rhino. Anywhere else it works as usual. Getting out on foot and back in
  keeps it marking rigs.
- **Forgot to tap?** The ✕ by a rig's slot in the legend marks it picked up.
- **Rigs still out:** docking the Rhino with rigs still marked out on the body says so, and a card shows it
  ("Rigs 2 and 5 still marked out; rig 5 is probably full."). It is Outrider's record, not the game's, so a
  rig picked up without a tap counts until you ✕ it.

**Automatic:** collections (the tons go to the rig under you, or an unmarked site, and are said once you
stop: "Rig 3: 12 tons of Water."), your ship's landing spot, mining locations you targeted from the ship, and
rigs lost at 5 km, on leaving the body, or with the Rhino destroyed, a death or a relog. **Not automatic:**
placing and picking up rigs, and what a deposit holds. A rig that collected anything is kept as a saved site
for your next visit and listed under Materials' **Mining sites**.

The map's sizes and the leash distance are in the thresholds table under Alerts; the spoken leash warning
always uses the config file's `rig_warn`.

## 🛣 The Neutron Highway

The **Highway** tab plots a route with [Spansh](https://spansh.co.uk), using neutron stars as boosts, and
follows it as you fly. One route is kept (following it needs no network) until you plot another or
**Clear route**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/highway.png" alt="The Highway tab: the jump list, and the route on a map of the galaxy's regions" width="900">
</p>

- **Two plotters.** **Exact** (the default) plans every jump with its fuel and refuel stops from your ship's own
  figures (drive, masses, tanks, Guardian booster, engineering) and your cargo. **Neutron** plans waypoints only,
  from a range, the supercharge (×4, or ×6 with the SCO Mk II) and an efficiency: for a ship you haven't flown, or
  a quick plot.
- **Ship.** Any ship you have flown, as of its latest Loadout. The neutron plotter's **Range** starts at that
  ship's laden range; type another to override it.
- **Conservative range** (off by default): jumps a margin (5 ly) shorter than the ship's range, leaving room for a
  fuller tank.
- **Too much fuel.** A long neutron jump may be in range only with the fuel the plotter expected. On arrival, and
  as you scoop, Outrider checks the next jump against the fuel aboard and warns ("⚠ too much fuel for the next
  jump: ≤ 36 t, you have 140 t").
- **The list** shows the next 200 jumps with distance, ⚡ neutron, fuel and ⛽ refuel stops (the exact plotter's: the
  neutron plotter has none, scoop as you go); click a name to copy
  it. The map beside it draws the route on the galactic regions with landmarks and your carrier. You can put your
  own galaxy image under it (`background_image`, an EDAstro chart say).
- **Following.** Arriving at any route system moves you along, forwards or back; anywhere else (a respawn
  included) is **Off Route: Detour** until you are back on it, with the closest route system marked. A line under
  the tiles shows the next stop ("🛣 Next: Hwy Stop 38 · ⚡ neutron · 4.2 ly · 38 of 399 · refuel in 3 jumps").
- **Clipboard.** On arrival the next system's name goes on the desktop clipboard for the galaxy map (Linux:
  `wl-copy` or `xclip`).
- **The voice:** "Next Neutron Highway Stop: Hwy Stop 38, with three jumps left to refuel. Boost your FSD to
  continue.", plus refuel stops, detours, "Back on the highway", "Highway complete" and the fuel warning.

**Auto-target** (Linux, off by default; the tab's **Auto-target the next system** box). After an FSD supercharge
in a route system it waits 5 s, then presses keys to make the next route system your target: it opens the galaxy
map, searches for the system, plots the route, closes the map and checks the target took. It says "Successfully
targeted neutron jump target Hwy Stop 38" (or "Failed to…") under its own alerts row.

- **Keyboard bindings:** Galaxy Map Open, UI Up, UI Select and the galaxy map's Camera Yaw Right and Camera Zoom
  Out need one (the box lists any missing; a built-in preset can't be read). It shares auto honk's virtual keyboard;
  honk goes first.
- Switching it off, clearing the route or plotting a new one stops a run at once, even mid-way. If the game targets
  a different system it says so by name ("Targeted the wrong system: …. Check before you jump."). A waypoint the
  game reaches by a plotted route of several jumps counts as targeted.
- It never runs docked, landed, in a vehicle or on foot, in danger, with the FSD charging or a panel open. It stops
  if anything unexpected happens, closing the map only if it opened it.
- **The keys go to whichever window has focus**: stay in the game until it is done.
- The log gets one line per run ("highway auto-target: targeted Hwy Stop 38"); every step is printed only when it
  fails.
- **🎯 Target next** (in the box, and beside "Next:" in the route line on Overview, Nearby and Here) does the same
  on demand, whether or not auto-target is on: the next route system, or off the route the closest one, after a
  5-second countdown to click back into the game. A failed run puts **⟳ Retry** on its route row.
- **Test now** in the box targets the nearest known system a plain jump away, after a 5-second countdown.
  `python3 -m outrider.target --show` prints the steps with your keys.
- Every step can be changed under `[highway]` (`autotarget_search`, `autotarget_submit`, `autotarget_plot`…) if a
  game update moves things; `autotarget_entry = "paste"` pastes the name instead of typing it.
- **Frontier's rules:** this is key-press automation like auto honk (and tools such as Auto_Neutron). Whether to
  use it is your call.

## 🎯 Auto honk

On Linux, Outrider can fire the Discovery Scanner for you. On arriving by hyperspace it waits a moment,
holds Primary Fire, and says how it went ("System Scan Completed, 12 Bodies discovered"). It is off until
you tick it in the 🔔 alerts dialog.

- It waits while a map or panel is open, and while the HUD is in combat mode (switch to analysis mode).
- It learns which fire groups the scanner is in, per ship, and waits on a group where it has missed twice in a
  row (one miss can be an alt-tab, which sends the key to another window).
  The dialog's **forget** clears that after you move the scanner.
- It skips systems you've already honked, Apex shuttles and multicrew.

Setting it up:

- **The Discovery Scanner must be on primary fire** in the fire group active when you jump.
- **Primary Fire needs a keyboard binding** in Elite's controls (as its second binding, if your trigger is
  the first). Outrider reads it from your active controls preset, modifiers too. A built-in preset can't be
  read: save it as a custom preset, or set `[autohonk] key`. A binding that needs a joystick modifier can't
  be pressed.
- **Try it first.** The dialog's *test in 5 s* button, or `python3 -m outrider.honk --test 10`, holds Primary Fire
  once. `python3 -m outrider.honk --show` prints the binding it will press.
- It presses keys through a virtual keyboard (`evdev`; Steam's controller rule already gives you access),
  and **the keys go to whichever window has focus**, so switch it off before alt-tabbing away mid-jump.

## 🕹️ The co-pilot button

On Linux, one button on your HOTAS (or a spare key) talks to the voice:

- **Tap:** a status report: fuel and jumps (and any core module under your level), on a Highway route the boost
  and the next route system, the next stop, what is aboard against your rebuy, and the nearest unvisited system
  (left out while you follow a route). With a body targeted it leads with that body
  ("A 3: 2.4 g, thin ammonia, 3 bio signals, up to 19 million, about 2 minutes, worth it"); mid-run on a body,
  the sampling. A tap mid-line cuts it short.
- **Double tap:** the last line again.
- **Hold:** hush until the next jump; hold again to end it.
- **In the Rhino** on a planet, any press marks rigs instead (see The surface map).

Set it up under `[copilot]` in `ed_outrider.toml`: `enabled = true`, the `device` (part of its name, such
as `"X-56 Rhino Throttle"`, or a `/dev/input/by-id/…` path; of several devices that match, the one that has the
button is used) and the `button`. Run
`python3 -m outrider.button --listen` to find the button's name. `hold_ms` and `double_ms` tune the gestures. The
alerts dialog shows whether it is listening.

- **Unbind the button in Elite's controls.** Outrider only reads it, so the game would act on it too.
- **X-56 users:** avoid the latching toggles and the mode wheel. They report as buttons held down, which
  reads as one endless hold.
- **Access:** joysticks and throttles are readable by the logged-in user on most distributions (`uaccess`).
  A keyboard or mouse needs your user in the `input` group, which lets every program read your typing, so a
  joystick button is the better choice.

## 🧭 Good to know

> [!NOTE]
> **"Not on the page" means "nobody with an uploader has reported it."** Players who don't run
> EDMC or a similar tool never reach Spansh or EDSM, so a missing system is *almost* certainly
> undiscovered. A second after you arrive, the arrival star's scan settles it — and the page
> (and the voice) says which it was.

- **Exobiology guesses are possibilities, not promises.** They come from each species' known spawn
  conditions, as maintained by the [BioScan](https://github.com/Silarn/EDMC-BioScan) project, including
  its check on which star types a species appears around. Until every body is found, nothing is ruled out
  on what isn't known yet. The genus is usually right, the species sometimes not, so values show as
  "up to". The ✦ "new to your codex" mark checks the colour variant when it can be told. Each start checks
  GitHub for newer rules.
- **Values are estimates** using the community tools' formula, bonuses included. An NPC crew member's cut
  comes off automatically, based on what your past sales paid.
- **Losing your ship loses your data.** Discoveries and samples that went down show as *lost* until you scan
  them again. Scanning a body you've already sold adds nothing; only mapping it still pays.
- **Small things worth knowing:** the pill at the top right says whether the page is linked to Outrider ("stale"
  after 30 s without an answer); Here's Dist, Grav, Now and Max headings sort the bodies; a genus's tooltip gives
  its colony distance; Search's mining list includes minerals you have refined, with those bodies first; the
  alerts dialog's chips jump to its sections; and the dialog's Settings choose whether the header tiles fold to
  one line on a small window, on this device.

## ⚙️ Settings

<details>
<summary>Outrider needs no configuration — but everything can be changed.</summary>
<br>

Copy `ed_outrider.toml.example` to `ed_outrider.toml` next to the script and edit the lines you need.
The example explains every key. Relative paths in it (`db`, `backup_dir`, `speech_file`) are relative to the
Outrider folder; they default to `data/ed_outrider.sqlite`, `data/backups` and `resources/speech.json`.
`python3 ed_outrider.py --write-config` writes one with the settings in effect. Switches take a bare `true` or
`false`; a wrong value is reported at start and the default kept.

| Section | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `[journals]` | `live` and `legacy` folders, when auto-detection misses them (setting `live` turns off legacy auto-detection: list `legacy` too) |
| `[server]` | `host`, `port`, `password`, `allowed_hosts`, `radius`, `radius_choices`, `db`, `backup_dir`, `backup_keep`, `backup_every_days`, `speech_file` |
| `[defaults]` | What a new browser starts with: thresholds (`unsold_warn`, `unsold_urgent`, `bio_min`, `body_highlight_level`, `biology_highlight_value`, `body_max_value_include_bonus`, `high_gravity`, `module_warn`), `sounds`, `voice`, `voice_fallback`, `speech_styles`, `speech_profanity`, `speech_profanity_pct`, `speech_danger_business`, `speak_bio_signals`, `speak_geo_signals`, `speak_mapped`, `codex_interesting`, `speech_speed`, `speech_names`; the surface map's `surface_alt`, `rig_spacing`, `surface_map_min`, `surface_map_strip`, `rig_warn` |
| `[spansh]` | `concurrency`, `map_max_radius`, `map_max_pages`, `watch_firsts` |
| `[autohonk]` | `enabled`, `key`, `delay`, `hold`, `skip_honked`, `announce` |
| `[speech]` | `server_player`, for **Play speech and sounds on this PC**; `sound_dir`, your own alert sounds |
| `[copilot]` | `enabled`, `device`, `button`, `hold_ms`, `double_ms` |
| `[mcp]` | `url`, `max_rows`: for the MCP bridge (see Ask an AI) |
| `[highway]` | `clipboard`, `efficiency`, `conservative`, `conservative_ly`, `background_image`, `background_extent`, `background_opacity`; auto-target: `autotarget`, `autotarget_delay`, `autotarget_entry`, `autotarget_map_wait`, `autotarget_search_wait`, `autotarget_key_delay`, `autotarget_keys`, `autotarget_search`, `autotarget_submit`, `autotarget_plot`, `autotarget_dry_run` |

Command-line flags override the file for a single run:

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `--radius`, `--host`, `--port` | Search radius, address and port |
| `--db PATH` | Database file (for a second copy) |
| `--config PATH` | Config file to use |
| `--write-config` | Write the settings in effect to the config file (never overwrites) |
| `--journals PATH`, `--legacy PATH` | Journal folders to follow, or older ones to import once (repeatable) |
| `--rescan` | Rebuild from the journals, keeping the Spansh cache |
| `--restore [ZIP]`, `--list-backups` | See Backups |
| `--simulate` | For screenshots and demos: the panels show the last known values (fuel...) as if the game were running; auto honk, auto-target, the co-pilot button and the clipboard are off |

**Opening the page from another device.** Outrider listens on 127.0.0.1 only unless `[server] host` says
otherwise (`"0.0.0.0"` for your network). It answers to any IP address, but by name only to `localhost`,
the configured host and this machine's name; add others (a router's `mypc.lan`, say) to
`[server] allowed_hosts`. This, and refusing changes sent by other web sites, stops a malicious page
from reading your journals or pressing keys. It does not stop people on your network, so set
`[server] password` as well: a tablet or phone then shows a sign-in page once and stays signed in (also across
Outrider restarts) until you change the password. This PC itself never asks. The page is plain http, so the password
crosses your network unencrypted: pick one you use nowhere else. Without one, anything on your network can read
the page and change bookmarks.
